                <p class="p">I am a full stack developer and I started with zero knowledge.
                  Everyone has their own way of learning. I am sharing the path which I took to reach where I am.
                First learn the basics of web development.
                Start with HTML: Learn to use HTML. Buy a book or use online sites like w3school or geekforgeek.
                After HTML learn basics of CSS: CSS is used to decorate a website and also animate the buttons or anything.
                Now that you can create simple web pages, keep practicing daily till you are confident with HTML and CSS.
                Next step is a bit hard and may need a guide.
               You need to learn any database application to link with your website. I learnt the database MySql first. using database with website enables the website to save information. After learning to use a database application like MySql, try connecting it to the web pages that you have built. For connecting MySql with your website, you need to learn a server side language like PHP.
                If you can complete the above steps then you can surely learn other side languages like JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap etc.</p>
